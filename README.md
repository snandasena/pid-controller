### Introduction

*In this project we'll revisit the lake race track from the [Behavioral Cloning Project](https://github.com/snandasena/behavioral-cloning). This time, however, we'll implement a PID controller in C++ to maneuver the vehicle around the track!*

*The simulator will be provided the cross track error (CTE) and the velocity (mph) in order to compute the appropriate steering angle.*
